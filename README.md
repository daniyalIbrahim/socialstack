## What's Inside

- Pure Golang, rest-api only using standard go packages
- Rest Api with [net/http](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/)
- CRUD using Mongo Golang Driver and Mongo Atlas Distributed Database
- [crypto/bcrypt](https://golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt) for password hashing
- Dockerfile
- CI/CD to Google Cloud Run

## How Robust is This Service
- Using a NO/SQL DB storing json data
- Not using a JWT,but session management system
  - at each login the user receives a newly generated session id
  - at each logout the user deletes the session id from the database
  - at each request the service checks if the session id is valid and present in the DB
  - if not, the service returns a 401 error
- Can not register with the same email twice
- All fields are validated using Regex expressions
- All HTTP request errors are handled using a custom error handler
- All HTTP request are logged using a custom logger
- All User Endpoints are inaccessible if the user logs out

## How to Use This Service
- Register with your email and password
- Login with your email and password
- Get a new session id
- Use the session id to access all the endpoints
- Logout to delete the session id
